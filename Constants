// Go supports constants of character, string, boolean, and numeric types

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

// const declares a constant value

const s string = "constant"

func/ main() {
	fmt.Println(s)

	// A const statement can appear anywhere a var statement can

	const n = 50000000

	// Constant expressions perform arithemtic with arbitary precision

	const d = 3e20 / n
	fmt.Println(d)

	// A numeric constant has no type until it is given one, such as by an explicit conversion

	fmt.Println(int64(d))

	// A number can be givena  type by using it in a context that requires one, such as a variable assignment or a function call
	// e.g. here, math.Sin expects a float64

	fmt.Println(math.Sin(n))
